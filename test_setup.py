# Configuration file for nose-testconfig that sets:
# a) the test platforms file
# b) the chemical mechanism to test
# c) the maximum number of threads to test
# d) the relative / absolute tolerances
# e) the languages to test
# f) the reaction sorting method to use
# All test configuration variables  can be specified on the command line via
# ENV variables (prefixed with PYJAC_) if desired
# e.g. PYJAC_GAS=mymech.cti PYJAC_TEST_PLATFORM=my_platform.yaml nosetests ...
# or simply feel free to modify the below...
# NOTE: supplied enviroment variables with override variables set in this test config
